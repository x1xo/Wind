# Wind üí®: A REST API to get your discord status

Wind is a simple REST API that allows users to get their discord
status through API instead of Websockets. It's a great service
for showing your status on a portfolio or something.

## Endpoints üõ£Ô∏è
### `/presence`

This endpoint requires a `Authentication` header with the API key
that can be generated through the bot using `/get-api`. The API key
can get the status of the user that generated the API key for security purposes.

It also requires and `id` parameter with the id of the discord user
that wants to retrive the status information.

**Example Response:**
```
{
    user: {
        id: "the id of the user",
        //other fields would probably be empty
    },
    status: "online" | "idle" | "dnd" | "invisible" | "offline",
    activities: [
        name: "name of the activity",
        type: 4, //see bellow
        url: "",
        created_at: Date,
        application_id: "",
        state: ""
        timestamps: {
            "start": Date,
            "end": Date
        },
        emoji: {},
        party: {},
        assets: {},
        secrets: {},
    ],
    client_status: {
        "desktop": "online",
        "mobile": "",
        "web": ""
    }
}
```

**Activity Types:**
```
Game      = 0
Streaming = 1
Listening = 2
Watching  = 3
Custom    = 4
Competing = 5
```
